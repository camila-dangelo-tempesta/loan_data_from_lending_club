# **Loan data from Lending Club**

## Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing with NumPy

In this Data Science project we have a dataset extremely complicated, containing data with many strings, special characters, problems encoding, badly formatted dates, 
numbers and texts in the same column, url's containing Ids important for analysis, missing values, column that contains information that should be distributed in three 
or more columns. And as if all this were not enough, part of the data needed for analysis is in another dataset, which must be combined with the first.

It is exactly this scenario that we are reproducing in this case study 1.

## 1. BUSINESS PROBLEMS

For this Case Study we worked with real, publicly available data representing thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to
other individuals.

From complex data and with many problems, we will do extensive cleaning and preprocessing work. And all this using only NumPy, a powerful Python language package for computing and data processing.

Our goal is to clean and pre-process the data, leaving it in the ideal format for a further analysis process and several decisions will have to be made along the way.
At the end of the work, we must save the dataset with the clean and pre-processed data.

## 2. BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS

Data from [Loan data from Lending Club](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=loans_full_schema) is available at . This dataset represents thousands of loans made through the Lending Club platform, which is a platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals.

In addition, we will use the dataset with a quotation of the dollar against the euro. we extracted a small sample of data from the [website](https://finance.yahoo.com)
